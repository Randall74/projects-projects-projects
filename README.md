<h2>The Big Idea</h2>
<p>This is an idea I've been thinking about for some time and have finally decided to go ahead and try to see how I do.</p>

<p>I jokingly refer to this project idea as 'An App a Day', based on The Family Guy episode. While I won't be downloading an app every day - or even attempting to submit one app every day - my goal is to go through any course, tutorial, book, magazine, blog, etc. that I can find and work through the example(s) and add them here. </p>

<p>This will be a combined effort of me learning something new, while building my projects portfolio. I will also attempt to add my own "flair" by using my background knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS, Ruby, PHP, etc.</p>
